              <h1>Importance of Developing Logical Reasoning, Cognitive Ability, and Critical Thinking Skills</h1>

              <p>Logical reasoning is the foundation for math, computer science, and many other disciplines. Competitive exams such as the science and math Olympiads aim to gauge students’ progress in this lifelong skill.</p>

              <h3>Critical thinking </h3>
              <p>Critical thinking is the skill one obtains over time by thinking and developing logic, judgment, and taking decisions open-mindedly and coherently in the real world.</p>

              <h3>Cognitive ability</h3>
              <p>Cognitive ability is the individual's ability to process thoughts and information. It is not just limited to learning or grasping. It also includes acting on that and developing that information into higher-order logical thinking. Age-appropriate mental ability tests and Olympiad examinations can help people to incorporate this into practice.These skills get compounded as people acquire new information and experiences. We all deal with opportunities as well as problems in the real world from time to time. That is why we suggest nurturing these skills early on.</p>

              <h4>This is why we say these skills are essential</h4>

              <h5>Encourages Independent Thinking</h5>
              <p>People initially require a lot of demonstration in education to help them learn and comprehend. Since problem-solving requires a great deal of reasoning and analysis, prolonged and frequent demonstration does not work.</p>
              <p>One can teach and demonstrate how to play the game of chess. However, the exact same strategy used in the demonstration does not work in the next match. This is where <b>logical reasoning skills</b> make room for independent thinking. People must learn new perspectives to solve the problem each time.</p>

              <h5>Promotes Creativity and Innovation</h5>
              <p>By thinking out of the box, people get creative solutions to the problems they face. This is true whether it is a school math problem today or a more important professional dilemma years down the road. Critical thinking allows us to innovate our ideas better and gives a sense of control over the events in our lives.</p>

              <h5>Enhances Analytical Thinking</h5>
              <p>As people begin to think independently, they also begin to understand the options they possess. They start weighing down possible results from all sides,evaluatingdifferent options, and eventually, arrive at the most favorable outcome. Multiple-choice questions or problems with various ways to reach the desired answer are very beneficial. The similar-looking answers make them think deeper before coming to a final solution.</p>

              <h5>Strengthens the Brain</h5>
              <p>Diverse types of tasks activate various parts of the brain such as memory, verbal-logical memory, visual-shape memory, and more. Verbal reasoning tests and logical reasoning tests enable people to distinguish between fact and fiction, animate and inanimate objects, shapes and models in math, theory, and complex equations. Thus, it truly unlocks the full potential of the brain.</p>

              <h5>Enhances Focus</h5>
              <p>Cognitive ability tests are a proven way to increase the person's concentration. These tests require the person's focus on problem-solving for more than 10-20 minutes. The methods and strategies keep them hooked and focused as it involves step by step process of solving. The heightened focus thus leads to developing positive self-esteem.</p>
